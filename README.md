# CS455-HW3-PC
CS455 Homework 3: Programming Component

* Each folder in ```programs``` represents an individual program for this project. The ```HW3``` folder combines programs Q1-Q6 into a single map reduce program which writes the output for each problem into individual folders.

* Build the project using ant, then run with Hadoop. For example, to run HW3 use the command ```$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar dist/HW3.jar cs455.hadoop.hw3.HW3Job```. This assumes access to original cluster for this project.
